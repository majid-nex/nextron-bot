## Mandatory Vars

- Only two of the environment variables are mandatory.

- If you face error like this `struct error of 275 byte like this` 
- So it is because you log in many devices just terminate devices and make string

    - `APP_ID`:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org

    - `API_HASH`:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org

- The userbot will not work without setting the mandatory vars.
